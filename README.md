### 1. Introduction
This README file provides an overview of the Home Loan dataset and instructions on how to use Power BI for data visualization. The dataset contains information about customers, loan applications, sanctioned amounts, recovery amounts, products, and channel IDs.

### 2. Dataset Description
The Home Loan dataset consists of the following columns:

**Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer. <br> 
**Loan Application**: The date when the customer applied for a home loan. <br> 
**Loan Application**: The date when the customer applied for a home loan. <br>  
**Loan Application**: The date when the customer applied for a home loan. <br>
**Loan Application**: The date when the customer applied for a home loan. <br>
**Sanction Amount**: The amount of the loan that was approved and sanctioned to the customer. <br>
**Recovery Amount**: The amount recovered from the customer, typically through loan repayments. <br>
**Products**: The type of home loan product the customer applied for. <br>
**Channel ID**: The channel through which the customer applied for the loan. <br>

### 3. Power BI Setup
To create visualizations for the Home Loan dataset using Power BI, follow these steps: <br>

**Load the Data**:

Open Power BI Desktop. <br>
Click on "Home" in the top menu. <br>
Choose "Get Data" and select the appropriate data source (e.g., Excel, CSV, or SQL database) to load your Home Loan dataset. <br>
Data Cleaning and Transformation: <br>

Once you have loaded the data, you may need to clean and transform it. Ensure that data types are correctly set, and any missing or inconsistent data is handled.
Data Modeling: <br>

Create relationships between tables if necessary. <br>
Define calculated columns or measures for more complex calculations. <br>
DAX measures used like SUM, COUNT, CALCULATE, FILTER, AVERAGE. <br>
**Data Visualization**:

Used the various visualizations available in Power BI, such as bar charts, pie charts, tables, and maps, to represent the data in a meaningful way. <br>
Used Key Influencers AI Visual, Slicers, and KPIs. <br>
**Customization and Formatting**:

Customize the visuals, add titles, and format your report to make it visually appealing and easy to understand. <br>
**Interactivity**:

Add filters, slicers, and other interactive elements to allow users to explore the data. <br>

### 4. Data Visualization
Here are some examples of visualizations you can create using Power BI with the Home Loan dataset: <br>

**Loan Application Trend**: Line chart showing the trend of loan applications over time. <br>

**Sanctioned Amount by Product**: A stacked column chart showing the sanctioned amounts for each product category. <br>

**Recovery Amount vs. Sanctioned Amount**: A scatter plot to analyze the relationship between recovery amounts and sanctioned amounts. <br>

**Channel Distribution**: A pie chart or donut chart displaying the distribution of loan applications by channel. <br>

**Customer Demographics**: Create visualizations to explore customer demographics, such as age, gender, or location, if available in the dataset. <br>

**Loan Status**: Use conditional formatting to indicate the status of loans (e.g., paid off, outstanding, default) with color-coded visuals. <br>

### 5. Conclusion
With Power BI, I have turned the Home Loan dataset into insightful and interactive visualizations and built a 4-page report, enabling me to make data-driven decisions and gain valuable insights into the home loan business. Experimented with different visualizations and explored the data to uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities.##
